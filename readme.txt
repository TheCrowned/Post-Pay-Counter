Easily handle authors' payments on a multi-author blog by computing posts' remuneration basing on admin defined rules.

== Description ==
Easily calculate and handle authors' pay on a multi-author blog. Set up the wished payment criteria and let the plugin compute posts payment. Stats are immediately be viewable. Both a general view with all users and a specific one for each author are possible. It can easily help you implement a revenue sharing/paid to write model for your business.

[Plugin HOMEPAGE](https://postpaycounter.com)

**Features include:**

* Pay per post, word, visit ([tutorial](https://postpaycounter.com/pay-writers-per-visit-wordpress?utm_source=wprep&utm_medium=link)), image and comment (not mutually exclusive).
* Pay with an incremental system (eg. each word is €0.01 => 100 words = €1) or with a zonal one (eg. from 200 to 300 words/visits it’s €2.00, up to 10 zones).
* No account needed. Data is yours, no need to sign-up to anything really.
* Old stats availability. View posts countings since the first written post, disregarding the plugin install date. A fancy date picker lets you shift between days and select the desired range, or pick a ready choice (such as *This month*, *Last month*...).
* Responsive and sortable stats: optimized stats page for mobile devices and sortable stats table.
* Personalize user's settings, so that special settings only apply to a particular user. Different settings can be made apparent in the stats or hidden depending on your needs.
* Customizable permissions to prevent your users to see stats and use functions they are not supposed to.
* Extend with your own custom implementation through hooks, filters and special API features ([learn more](https://postpaycounter.com/add-custom-payment-types-post-pay-counter-stats?utm_source=wprep&utm_medium=link)).
* And... works with custom post types, narrow your payments only to chosen user groups, supports pagination, and even more!

The [PRO version](https://postpaycounter.com/post-pay-counter-pro?utm_source=wprep&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=ppcp) includes Analytics visits payment, Adsense Revenues sharing, payments management and PayPal payments.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the directory of the Post Pay Counter in your wp-content/plugins directory; note that you need the whole folder, not only the single files.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Activate" button in the "Plugins" page of your WordPress.
3. Head to the configuration page first. The plugin already comes with a predefined set of settings, but you may want to set it up to better suit your needs.
5. That's it, you are done! You can now check the stats page to browse all the countings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= You said I could pay per visit. How do I do that? =
There's an [apt tutorial here](http://postpaycounter.com/pay-writers-per-visit-wordpress). However, note that Post Pay Counter does not keep track of visits, it can only keep it in mind when computing the payment. You either need to have a plugin who keeps track of visits, and put the post_meta name of the field in which it stores the visits (must be a number), or get the PRO version of Post Pay Counter and use your Google Analytics account to get visits data.

= I installed the plugin but it does not show up in the menu. Also, if I go to the settings page, it says I am not authorized =
That is probably due to a permissions manager plugin you have on your blog. Check that capabilities *post_pay_counter_access_stats* and *post_pay_counter_manage_options* are correctly assigned and working.

= Can I pay for BBPress contents? =
It is indeed possible to pay for BBPress topics and replies with Post Pay Counter.

In *Post Pay Counter > Options > Miscellanea > Allowed post types*, make sure you have *Topic* and *Reply* ticked, and those types of contents will be included in countings.

You can have a look at the [apt tutorial](https://postpaycounter.com/how-to-pay-per-bbpress-topics-and-replies/) for more details.

= I don't want errors to be logged =
Set to *false* the constant *PPC_DEBUG_LOG* in *post-pay-counter.php*, it is located at line 44.
From this: *define( 'PPC_DEBUG_LOG', true );*
It must become: *define( 'PPC_DEBUG_LOG', false );*

* Tweak: preventing (for 6 hours) notifications update if the request generated an error.
* Fixed: couple of non-static methods called statically.

... several old versions changes removed ...

= 2.0 =
**IMPORTANT NOTICE: Versions 2.0 or higher need to be reinstalled** if you had a previous version due to its different settings storage system and the availability of new features. Also, the **following features are currently missing**: post payment bonus, trial settings, csv esport, full multisite integration, word count in post list. They will be added soon. If you need one specifically, let me know in order to make up a priority list.

* Almost complete plugin redesign and code refactoring which should give dramatic speed improvements. Less data is stored in the database, making requests lighter.
* The plugin is now fully extensible, check the list of hooks and filters.
* Supports localization.
* Words and visits are not mutually esclusive counting types anymore.
* Plugin's visits counting method is not available anymore. If you use some other plugin to keep track of visits, you can specify its postmeta and Post Pay Counter will use that. Post Pay Counter PRO (soon available) will allow use of Google Analytics.
* Images and comments can now use both incremental and zones payment system.
* Up to 10 zones are allowed now.
* Feature to allow payment only when certain threshold is met.
* Settings save is now AJAX working.

A paid addon to Post Pay Counter, PRO, will be released soon, adding more new features.
